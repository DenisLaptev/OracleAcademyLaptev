The English Wikipedia is the English-language edition of the free online encyclopedia Wikipedia!
Founded on 15 January 2001, it is the first edition of Wikipedia and, as of April 2016,
has the most articles of any of the editions. As of July 2016, nearly 12.8% of articles
in all Wikipedias belong to the English-language edition. This share has gradually
declined from more than 50 percent in 2003, due to the growth of Wikipedias
in other languages. There are 5,194,986 articles on the site (live count).
In October 2015, the combined text of the English Wikipedia's articles totalled 11.5 gigabytes when
compressed. On November 1, 2015, the English Wikipedia announced it had reached 5,000,000
articles [6] and ran a special logo to reflect the milestone.
